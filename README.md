# Configuring your Ubuntu-based PC for Quantitative Social Science Work
This file will help you get your Ubuntu-based Linux machine up and
running to do quantitative social science data work. It was inspirited
by the similarly-titled
[SocialScienceMacConfig](https://github.com/jwbowers/SocialScienceMacConfig)
put together by Jake Bowers and Jeff Gill.

Steps should be similar or identical in other Debian-based Linux
distros. For other Linux systems, you'll probably have access to
everything I describe here, but may need to change the commands a
bit.

Most (all?) programs included in this list are
[FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software). Thus,
they are also available on Windows and Mac. Just
google around to find out how to get them for your operating system. 

# Step 0: Install Ubuntu
This is not meant as a manual to help you install Ubuntu. However,
you can install Ubuntu on pretty much any computer. I use the 6-month
rolling releases instead of the LTS. You can get more information
about how to install Ubuntu from
[Ubuntu's website](http://www.ubuntu.com/). A quick Google search will
also pull up helpful instructions. Be sure to test it out from a
bootable USB or other disc before installing it. This'll make sure
that it works well on your computer. 

# Step 1: Install programs from Ubuntu's repositories
You'll want Emacs (at least 24) for LaTeX, markdown, R, and git. Yes,
it really does all of that. You'll also want
[ESS](http://ess.r-project.org/) (Emacs Speaks Statistics), which
provides a way for Emacs and R to cooperate. Pandoc takes care of
converting between markdown, latex, pdf, and many other file
formats. Finally, you'll want git for all your version control needs. 

    sudo apt-get install emacs24 ess pandoc git

If you're doing Bayesian statistics and want to be able to use JAGS,
you'll also need to get JAGS, which is available and up-to-date on
Ubuntu's repositories: `sudo apt-get install jags`.

## Step 1a: Configure git
You'll need to tell git your name and email. Run these two commands in
the terminal, replacing the "John Doe" information with your name and
email:

    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

The global option will tell git to remember those values, so you
shouldn't have to do this again. 

# Step 2: Install R
Installing R on an Ubuntu type Linux distribution is easy. You can
simply follow the steps
[here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README). Be sure to
read about the secure APT part. Note that you *can* get R from
Ubuntu's repositories, but you really shouldn't. The version there is
pretty dated (3.0 as of this writing, and the latest R version is 3.2.2)

## Step 2a: Configure CRAN mirror
This step isn't totally necessary, but it may save you some time in
the future. In your `.Rprofile` file (usually located at ~/), you can
set the CRAN mirror so that R doesn't ask you. I use RStudio's mirror,
since it should work fairly quickly anywhere in the world. If you want
to use a different mirror, replace `"https://cran.rstudio.com/"` with
your favorite CRAN mirror. You can find the full list of mirrors
[here](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html). 

    local({
      r <- getOption("repos")
          r["CRAN"] <- "https://cran.rstudio.com/"
              options(repos = r)
    })

## Step 2b: Install R packages
R can do a lot out of the box, but it's real strength lies in packages
that extend it. Here's a quick list of some of the packages that I
find myself using frequently:

    install.packages("lintr", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "zoo", "haven",
                     "rstan", "rjags", "MCMCpack", "rmarkdown",
                     "knitr", "reshape2", "servr")

# Step 3: Install TeXLive
This is a bit trickier than R. Ubuntu actually has TeXLive in its
repositories, but the version there tends to be a bit out of date. If
you want, you can install it via `sudo apt-get texlive-full`. Be
warned - it's a huge file, so it will take a lot of data (and time) to
download and install.

I really don't recommend doing that, though. You can install what's
referred to as "vanilla" TeXLive fairly easily. There's a stackoverflow
answer [here](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/95373) that gives
step-by-step instructions for how to get vanilla TeXLive set up on
your system. In addition to getting the most up-to-date version of
LaTeX, the vanilla version will also let you use TeXLive''s package
management system.

If you usually have regular access to the internet, I'd recommend
skipping the *doc* and *source*  files. They add a lot to the
installation and are totally unnecessary if you have internet
connectivity. 

If you're on a Mac, you can install [MaCTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) and Windows users probably
want [MiKTeX](http://www.miktex.org/). 

# Step 4: Configure Emacs
Emacs is infinitely configure-able. You could spend months (years?)
getting it *just* right. Feel free to do so. It's probably not worth
it, though. My advice is just to commit to using emacs, and develop
your specific configuration as you go. There are definitely a few
things that you'll want to set up beforehand, though.

I keep my .emacs file in
a [github repository](https://github.com/jabranham/emacs), so feel
free to check it out. If you drop the init.el file into ~/.emacs.d/,
it should work just fine on your setup. It adds the ability to connect
to [MELPA](https://melpa.org/) to your emacs setup, so you'll need an
internet connection the first time you use it.

I'm not sure I'd recommend just using my .emacs file, though (or
anyone else's). Setting up emacs yourself teaches you a bit about how
the program thinks. So I'll list some packages here that I think are
particularly invaluable:

* magit - for all your git needs, inside emacs
* auctex - for writing LaTeX
* polymode - for .Rnw (knitr + LaTeX) and .Rmd (rmarkdown) files
* ebib - for .bib file management
* markdown-mode - for working with markdown files
* reftex - this comes bundled with emacs in recent versions (so no
  need to install it separately), but makes
  working with .bib files a breeze 

Those are absolute must-haves for doing the sort of work we do. If you
work with languages other than R, LaTeX, and markdown, you'll want to
make sure you have the proper "major mode" for that language. ESS
(which you already installed above) makes emacs work with R, so no
need to do anything there. There are some other packages that just
make emacs work a little better, and I'll list some here:

* better-defaults - literally better defaults for emacs. Pretty much
everyone should use this
* smex - easier way to navigate commands (like `M-x`)
* There are several "ido" packages - go look them up. They'll make
your life easier.
* smartparens - easier parentheses management
* company - for autocompletion (there's also auto-complete, but I
prefer company)
* flyspell - for spell checking on the fly
* smooth-scrolling - for doing away with emacs' nonsense default
scrolling
* flycheck - checks for good style and syntax

There are tons more packages available, but those should get you
started.

## PDFs in emacs
`pdf-tools` is an emacs package to work with pdf files. The github
repo is [here](https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools). You'll need to
follow the installation instructions there. Note that you can't just
download it from MELPA, since you need to compile and install the C
part. In short, you can do:

    sudo apt-get install libpng-dev libz-dev 
    sudo apt-get install libpoppler-glib-dev 
    sudo apt-get install libpoppler-private-dev

You'll then need to clone the git repo somewhere. Navigate somewhere
where you want, then do:

    git clone https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools.git
    cd pdf-tools/
    make install-server-deps
    make -s

# Step 5: Profit!
You're now set up to use a combination of git, R, markdown, and LaTeX
in a sane working environment. You didn't have to pay a penny, either!
These programs (emacs and R in particular) have a bit of a learning
curve, but don't be dissuaded. There are tons of resources online that
can help you out. I also write about this kind of stuff on
[my blog](https://jabranham.github.io). 

# Step 6: Setting up your Machine to Serve Github Pages

If you run your personal website through
[github pages](https://pages.github.com/), then you probably want the
stuff in this section. Otherwise, skip it. Much thanks to
[this website](http://michaelchelen.net/81fa/install-jekyll-2-ubuntu-14-04/)
for proper instructions. You'll need several of jekyll's dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev make gcc nodejs

After that, you can actually install jekyll and `github-pages`:

    sudo gem install jekyll --no-rdoc --no-ri
    sudo gem install github-pages --no-rdoc --no-ri

Make sure the jekyll installed correctly:

    jekyll -v
