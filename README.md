# Configuring your Ubuntu-based PC for Quantitative Social Science Work
This file will help you get your Ubuntu-based Linux machine up and
running to do quantitative social science data work. It was inspirited
by the similarly-titled
[SocialScienceMacconfig](https://github.com/jwbowers/SocialScienceMacConfig)
put together by Jake Bowers and Jeff Gill.

# Step 0: Install Ubuntu
You can install Ubuntu on pretty much any computer. I use the 6-month
rolling releases instead of the LTS. You can get more information
about how to install Ubuntu from
[Ubuntu's website](http://www.ubuntu.com/). A quick Google search will
also pull up helpful instructions.

# Step 1: Install programs from Ubuntu's repositories
You'll want Emacs (at least 24) for text editing and working with R.
- [] `sudo apt-get install emacs24 ess`
You'll want git for version control:
- [] `sudo apt-get install git`
