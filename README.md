# A Linux Social Science Machine
This is my setup to make your linux-based PC into a social science
machine. Since there are many different linux distros, I've attempted
to customize the guide for several of the distros. The guides are
simply different branches in this git repo. Here are the github links
to the different distros: 

- [Ubuntu](https://github.com/jabranham/SocialScienceLinuxConfig/tree/ubuntu)
- [Arch Linux](https://github.com/jabranham/SocialScienceLinuxConfig/tree/arch-linux)
